# Pokémon Playground App

This repository is a place to play around and experiment with Svelte/SvelteKit using the PokéAPI.
On top of playing around with Svelte it is a place to learn and try to implement some common design
patterns on the web (infinite scroll, over-scroll up to reload, SSR, etc...).
